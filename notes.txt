functions needed

Use print() a lot to display messages about what is going on, what the script has found out,
what items it needs, what it is doing.
always use free delivery

use pictures to determine coordinates of items, then store coordinates for use making program more robust

need coordinates of everything
findOrder() - finds what orders are needed and compare to what order has already been taken so
a single order doesn't get counted twice. Or take all current orders, make them all, then take orders again, 
cleanPlate() - clicks on flashing plates that are different colors
inventory() compares order to what is in inventory
orderItem(item argument)
	clicks phone, exits phone call, can click all items
mat rolling takes 1.5 seconds to complete
store goes from open to close in 3 minutes

locateOnScreen() function is very slow.


can't afford ingredient?
	Can make a wallet variable that updates the amount of money I have
takes a few seconds to order an ingredient, don't reorder (6 seconds)

if there's excess dishes on the conveyor belt, can't place new item

findOrders() called too often
^ same issue of making too many orders, duplicates. if they leave the order is left on conveyer belt
